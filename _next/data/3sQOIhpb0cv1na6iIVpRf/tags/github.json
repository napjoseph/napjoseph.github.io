It used to be a manual process before, but luckily we can now use [GitHub's official CLI](https://cli.github.com/).\n\n## Why copy issue labels?\n\nHere are some common scenarios when you might need to copy issue labels between projects:\n\n- **Standardization**: If your Organization requires a standard list of issue labels for all projects, copying issue labels from an existing project with the required labels ensures consistency.\n- **Project Migration**: When a project is moved from one Organization to another, you might want to retain the issue labels to maintain the same workflow and issue categorization.\n- **Team Collaboration**: If multiple teams within an Organization work on similar projects, having a unified set of issue labels for better collaboration and understanding across teams is helpful.\n\n## Using the GitHub CLI\n\nBefore we dive into the process, make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, head to https://cli.github.com/ and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n\nYou can authenticate with the CLI using:\n\n```bash\ngh auth login\n```\n\nOnce you have the GitHub CLI installed and configured, you can copy issue labels between repositories by executing the following command:\n\n```bash\ngh label clone owner-name/source-repo-name --repo owner-name/destination-repo-name --force\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `gh`: The GitHub CLI command.\n- `label`: The command group for working with issue labels.\n- `clone`: The command to copy labels from one repository to another.\n- `owner-name/source-repo-name`: The source repository from which you want to copy the issue labels.\n- `--repo`: The flag to specify the destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.\n- `owner-name/destination-repo-name`: The destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.\n- `--force`: Optional flag to overwrite existing labels in the destination repository.\n\nDocumentation for the command can be found at https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_clone.\n\n> **NOTE**: Please note that you must have the necessary permissions (write access) for the destination repositories.\n\nOnce the command executes successfully, all issue labels from `owner-name/source-repo-name` will be copied to `owner-name/destination-repo-name`, ensuring that the latter now follows the Organization's standard list of issue labels.\n\n## Creating default labels for your Organization\n\nAs an Organization owner, you can also create default labels that will be automatically included in every new repository in your Organization. This is a convenient way to standardize issue labels across all projects within your Organization.\n\nPlease refer to the GitHub documentation on [Managing Default Labels for Repositories in Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization) for detailed instructions and screenshots.\n\n> **NOTE**: Adding, editing, or deleting a default label does not affect existing repositories. Default labels only apply to new repositories created after the changes.\n","excerpt":"\nIf you manage multiple projects across different GitHub Organizations, you may have faced a common scenario: the need to copy [GitHub issue labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) from one repository to another.
