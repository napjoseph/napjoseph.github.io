It used to be a manual process before, but luckily we can now use [GitHub's official CLI](https://cli.github.com/).\n\n## Why copy issue labels?\n\nHere are some common scenarios when you might need to copy issue labels between projects:\n\n- **Standardization**: If your Organization requires a standard list of issue labels for all projects, copying issue labels from an existing project with the required labels ensures consistency.\n- **Project Migration**: When a project is moved from one Organization to another, you might want to retain the issue labels to maintain the same workflow and issue categorization.\n- **Team Collaboration**: If multiple teams within an Organization work on similar projects, having a unified set of issue labels for better collaboration and understanding across teams is helpful.\n\n## Using the GitHub CLI\n\nBefore we dive into the process, make sure you have the GitHub CLI installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, head to https://cli.github.com/ and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n\nYou can authenticate with the CLI using:\n\n```bash\ngh auth login\n```\n\nOnce you have the GitHub CLI installed and configured, you can copy issue labels between repositories by executing the following command:\n\n```bash\ngh label clone owner-name/source-repo-name --repo owner-name/destination-repo-name --force\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the command:\n\n- `gh`: The GitHub CLI command.\n- `label`: The command group for working with issue labels.\n- `clone`: The command to copy labels from one repository to another.\n- `owner-name/source-repo-name`: The source repository from which you want to copy the issue labels.\n- `--repo`: The flag to specify the destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.\n- `owner-name/destination-repo-name`: The destination repository to which the issue labels will be copied.\n- `--force`: Optional flag to overwrite existing labels in the destination repository.\n\nDocumentation for the command can be found at https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_clone.\n\n> **NOTE**: Please note that you must have the necessary permissions (write access) for the destination repositories.\n\nOnce the command executes successfully, all issue labels from `owner-name/source-repo-name` will be copied to `owner-name/destination-repo-name`, ensuring that the latter now follows the Organization's standard list of issue labels.\n\n## Creating default labels for your Organization\n\nAs an Organization owner, you can also create default labels that will be automatically included in every new repository in your Organization. This is a convenient way to standardize issue labels across all projects within your Organization.\n\nPlease refer to the GitHub documentation on [Managing Default Labels for Repositories in Your Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization) for detailed instructions and screenshots.\n\n> **NOTE**: Adding, editing, or deleting a default label does not affect existing repositories. Default labels only apply to new repositories created after the changes.\n","excerpt":"\nIf you manage multiple projects across different GitHub Organizations, you may have faced a common scenario: the need to copy [GitHub issue labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels) from one repository to another.

While it offers free hosting for personal repositories, it doesn't allow deploying from repositories inside a GitHub Organization unless you subscribe to a paid plan.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll create a GitHub Action that duplicates the content of a repository inside a GitHub Organization to a repository in your personal GitHub account, allowing you to leverage Vercel's free hosting services.\n\n> **NOTE**: This approach may not be suitable for all scenarios, and ensuring proper security measures when dealing with sensitive data is essential.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A personal GitHub account\n- A repository within a GitHub Organization (source repository)\n- A separate repository in your personal account to host the copied files (destination repository)\n\n## Step 1: Generate SSH Keys\n\nYou'll need to generate an SSH Deploy Key to securely push your content from the organization's repository to the external repository. Although you can also use a Personal Access Token, an SSH deploy key is recommended as it minimizes the impact of potential security breaches.\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"$(git config user.email)\" -N \"\" -f github-<desitination-repo-name>\n```\n\nReplace the `<desitination-repo-name>` with the name of your destination repository and run the command. Afterwards, you should now have both public and private key files:\n\n- `github-<desitination-repo-name>.pub` (public)\n- `github-<desitination-repo-name>` (private)\n\n## Step 2: Add the private key to the Source Repository\n\n1. Visit the source repository's GitHub page.\n2. Click on \"Settings\" in the repository (not account settings).\n3. In the left-hand pane, click \"Secrets\", then \"Actions\".\n4. Click on \"New repository secret\".\n5. Name it `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` and paste the contents of the private key file.\n6. Click \"Save\".\n\n## Step 3: Add the public key to the Destination Repository\n\n1. Visit the destination repository's GitHub page.\n2. Click on \"Settings\" in the repository (not account settings).\n3. In the left-hand side pane, click on \"Deploy keys.\"\n4. Click on \"Add deploy key\".\n5. Paste the contents of the public key file.\n6. Enable \"Allow write access\".\n7. Click \"Save\".\n\n## Step 4: Disable GitHub Actions on the Destination Repository\n\n1. Visit the destination repository's GitHub page.\n2. Click on \"Settings\" in the repository (not account settings).\n3. Click on \"Actions\" and then \"General\".\n4. Select \"Disable actions\".\n5. Click \"Save\".\n\n## Step 5: Create a GitHub Action Workflow\n\nCreate a new GitHub Action workflow in your source repository by adding a YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory. Name the file `push-to-external-repo.yml` and paste the following content:\n\n```yaml filename=.github/workflows/push-to-external-repo.yml\nname: (main) push to external repo\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\njobs:\n  push-to-external-repo:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: push to external repository\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }}\n          publish_dir: .\n          external_repository: <your-username>/<destination-repo-name>\n          publish_branch: main\n          allow_empty_commit: true\n```\n\nReplace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<destination-repo-name>` with the name of the external repository in your personal account.\nThis action will copy everything from your organization's repository to your personal repository, including your GitHub Action workflows, so follow [Step 4](#step-4-disable-github-actions-on-the-destination-repository) to disable GitHub Actions on the destination repository.\n\n## Step 6: Run your workflow\n\nPush something to your `main` branch and see it be pushed to your `<your-username>/<destination-repo-name>` repository.\n\n## Step 7: Set up a project on Vercel\n\n1. On Vercel's \"New Project\" page, choose the account linked to the project under the \"Import Git Repository\" section.\n2. Find your personal repository in the list and select \"Import\".\n3. Vercel will automatically detect the framework and any necessary build settings. You can configure project settings, including build and development settings and environment variables, at this stage or later.\n4. Click the \"Deploy\" button. Vercel will create the project and deploy it based on the chosen configurations.\n","excerpt":"\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a popular cloud service platform designed for hosting [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications.
